### I Could've Invented That
Effective Java item 47, "Know and use the libraries," is ou
r favorite explanation of why using libraries is, by and large,
preferable to writing your own utilities. The final paragraph bears repeating:

> To summarize, don’t reinvent the wheel. If you need to do something that seems like it should be reasonably common,
> there may already be a class in the libraries that does what you want. If there is,
>use it; if you don’t know, check. Generally speaking, library code is likely to be better 
> than code that you’d write yourself and is likely to improve over time. This is no reflection 
>on your abilities as a programmer. Economies of scale dictate that library code receives far 
> more attention than most developers could afford to devote to the same functionality.
